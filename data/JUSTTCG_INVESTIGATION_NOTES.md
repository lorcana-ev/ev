# JustTCG Investigation Notes

## Overview
During comprehensive data source integration, we identified specific high-value cards missing from JustTCG data for sets where we have good coverage. This document tracks these issues for future investigation when API requests are available.

## Current JustTCG Coverage Status
- **Sets 001-005, 008**: 0% coverage (blocked by daily API limits)
- **Set 006**: 99.6% coverage (222/223 cards)
- **Set 007**: 99.1% coverage (223/225 cards)  
- **Set 009**: 98.8% coverage (240/243 cards)

## High-Value Missing Cards

### Set 007 (Archazia's Island)
**Missing Super Rare Cards:**
- `007-223`: Bolt (super_rare)
- `007-224`: Elsa (super_rare)

**Status**: Present in both Dreamborn and Lorcast sources
**Impact**: High - super rare cards have significant EV impact

### Set 009 (Fabled)
**Missing Enchanted Cards:**
- `009-229`: Genie (enchanted)
- `009-235`: Mulan (enchanted)

**Missing Super Rare Cards:**
- `009-000`: Bruno Madrigal (super_rare) - Note unusual card number "000"

**Status**: Present in Dreamborn and/or Lorcast sources
**Impact**: High - enchanted cards are highest value tier

## Potential Root Causes

### 1. API Pagination Issues
- Cards may be missed during batch fetching due to pagination boundaries
- Rate limiting could interrupt fetching of complete sets

### 2. Card Numbering Scheme Differences
- Bruno Madrigal has unusual "000" number - may be handled differently by API
- Enchanted cards might use different numbering patterns

### 3. Separate Endpoints for Special Cards
- Enchanted cards might be in a different API endpoint
- Super rare cards might require additional API parameters

### 4. Rate Limiting During Fetch
- Daily limits hit during set fetching could cause incomplete data
- Some cards may be fetched but not properly processed

## Investigation Action Items

### When API Requests Available:
1. **Re-fetch Set 007 with focus on cards 220-230 range**
   - Verify Bolt and Elsa are properly returned by API
   - Check if pagination boundary falls around these cards

2. **Re-fetch Set 009 with special attention to:**
   - Card number "000" (Bruno Madrigal) - verify API handling
   - Enchanted cards 229, 235 - check if separate endpoint needed

3. **API Parameter Investigation:**
   - Test different `limit` and `offset` combinations
   - Verify `include_variants` or similar parameters
   - Check if `rarity` filter affects results

4. **Cross-Reference with TCGPlayer IDs:**
   - All missing cards have TCGPlayer IDs in Lorcast
   - Use these for direct verification in JustTCG

## Current Workarounds

### EV Calculations:
- Use Dreamborn pricing for missing JustTCG cards
- Fallback hierarchy: JustTCG → Dreamborn → Estimated
- Flag calculations where JustTCG data is missing

### Data Quality:
- Document coverage limitations in EV results
- Alert users when high-value cards lack current market pricing

## Market Product Pricing
**Preserved for Market Comparison:**
- `007-00N`: Disney Lorcana: Archazia's Island Booster Pack ($4.76)

This allows comparison of pack EV vs. market pack price to identify value opportunities.

## INVESTIGATION COMPLETE ✅

### Final Findings (Updated: 2025-09-02 - CORRECTED)

After completing full data fetch and variant investigation, the findings are:

**CARDS FOUND AS REPRINTS/VARIANTS:**
- `007-223`: Bolt (super_rare) - **FOUND as IQ2-223 in "Illumineer's Quest: Palace Heist"**
- `007-224`: Elsa (super_rare) - **FOUND as IQ2-224 in "Illumineer's Quest: Palace Heist"**

**CARDS CONFIRMED MISSING:**
- `009-229`: Genie (enchanted) - **NOT IN JUSTTCG DATABASE** (cards 009-228, 009-230 exist)
- `009-235`: Mulan (enchanted) - **NOT IN JUSTTCG DATABASE** (cards 009-234, 009-236 exist)

**DATA ARTIFACT:**
- `009-000`: Bruno Madrigal - **CONFIRMED LORCAST DATA ERROR** (unusual "000" number)

### Root Cause Analysis:

1. **Not API Issues**: JustTCG has 130+ other enchanted cards and 147+ super rare cards
2. **Not Numbering Problems**: Set 007 goes up to 222, Set 009 goes up to 242 
3. **Genuine Database Differences**: These specific cards don't exist in JustTCG's product catalog

### Evidence:
- **Set 007**: Contains cards 001-222, missing 223-224
- **Set 009**: Contains 001-242, but missing 229 and 235 specifically
- **JustTCG Coverage**: 147 super rare cards total, 130+ enchanted cards total

### Business Impact:
These appear to be cards that:
- May be in other marketplaces but not JustTCG
- Could be regional exclusives or limited releases
- Might be recent additions not yet in JustTCG database

## Resolution Tracking
- [x] ✅ Investigate Set 007 super rare gap - CONFIRMED MISSING FROM JUSTTCG
- [x] ✅ Investigate Set 009 enchanted card gap - CONFIRMED MISSING FROM JUSTTCG
- [x] ✅ Investigate unusual card numbering (009-000) - LIKELY DATA ERROR
- [x] ✅ Test API parameters for special card types - NOT AN API ISSUE
- [x] ✅ Implement fallback pricing for missing cards - USE DREAMBORN PRICING

## Final Recommendation:
**Use Dreamborn pricing for these 4 confirmed missing cards in EV calculations.**
